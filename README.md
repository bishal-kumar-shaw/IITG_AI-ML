# IIT Guwahati AI&ML Course Implementation

## Overview

This repository has the basic implementation of most of the basic Machine Learning Algorithms with proper visualization. The python code is written in the jupyter notebook which has the required markdowns to help you understand the algorithm better.

## Content

The repository is divided into 5 modules - 

<ul>
  <li>Module 1: Mathematical Preliminaries</li>
  <li>Module 2: Dimensionality Reduction </li>
  <li>Module 3: Unsupervised Learning </li>
  <li>Module 4: Supervised Learning </li>
  <li>Module 5: Miscellaneous </li>
  
 </ul>
 There is a **Presentation** directory which has the theory behind each algorithm and its detailed explanation. The **Dataset** folder contains the datasets which are used in the various algorithms.
